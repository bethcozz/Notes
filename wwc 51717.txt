Python good beginners language b/c it's more readable.
Programming is logic -
python is interpreted language - no "compiling?"

Assembly = computer level, basic programming, all 1s and 0s
Computer can understand natively

Compiled languages - C, have to be taken and run thru compiling process to run

Interpreted language - python, interpreted to C, down to comp level

Interpreter is where you run your code.
Telling python to run your code, using the interpreter
called, but not being run by you

Interpreter: run line by line
a = 1+1
interpreter shows nothing
print a
you get your 2

but you can put everything that you want inside of a file, and
interpreter will run the whole thing!

*Variables
something you assign a value to

python = monty python, not the snake
**download python 3! have stopped developing py 2

_runner_tests.py is the file we are looking at:

#! = shebang - look for in this environment, python executable
 says, i want this to run in python
 utf-8 ? don't worry about it

 package - os.path
 function defined in os package
 path is function/module
 . is a joiner
 os is the package

 threeway package - functions part of the same project

 from runner.runner_tests.test_mountain import TestMountain

 runner/runner_tests/test_mountain (is what it means^)
 from test_mountain, which is inside runner_tests folder,
 import the TestMountain

 Python is a whitespace language - it needs the blanks to understand

 Interpreter is >>>
 $ means they aren't in the interpreter

 xxx() ALWAYS means it's a function
 class ALWAYS defined by class
 variable always variable, etc.

 Ruby is popular for front-end (websites)
 Javascript is mostly used on the web, databases sometimes
 Java can be front and back end, servers, databases

 Front end = what the user sees
 Back end = what makes it all run

 Python mostly used in back end, not front end
 Django = python based website system (front end)
 Pearl is similar to python, less wide

 R is mostly statistical, pretty much entirely
 Bootstrap = javascript framework for the web

 Php = right behind the web, mostly front end - interface for server/databases

 print(apples_to_oranges.__class__)
 __ __ is a built in function that you don't typically modify

 __what is this__

 Scratch, green foot, hour of code - graphical programming
 teaching logics, what loops are, if statements

Below is a loop:
 n = 1
 while n!= 5:
  print('n is not five')
  n = n+1


  LIST = anything in brackets [can hold multiple things]
  [1, 2, 3]
  element of a list
  0 indexed: 1 is the 0th element of the list

  listA = [1, 2, 3]
  listA(0)
  would return 1

  listA(-1)
  would return 3

  listB = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  listB[1:3]
  return 2, 3, and 4
  This is called slicing a list, based on the 0 index
